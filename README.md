This is a solution about  BigNumber two kinds of Problems.
Today I learn someting about bignumber from <<BroadViewOffer>>
the efficitive way to resolve bignumber is trastating the big number into the string stored.
The filename "add" is the code about two big signed interget numbers are add,it total 200 lines code.I debuge it in about all situations,and it works well.
The filename "QuanSort" is the code about print 1 to n-bit digits .it more quickly to the filename "BigNumber" .it adopt the mind of Recursive.fianlly,the FUNCTION named PrintNumber() is very useful.
